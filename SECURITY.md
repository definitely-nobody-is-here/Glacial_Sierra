# Security Policy

## Database URL

The database URI will not be disclosed. Any release of database credentials to the public will allow modification, deletetion, and injection of user accounts. Don't ask for it, you can use your own local database or set up your own SQL database.

## Supported Versions

Supported Versions are stable versions that can run without breaking the format of accounts. Run non-supported versions at your own risk. ("risk" meaning a near-guaranteed inventory loss)
